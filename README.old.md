# React-Todo

Need a few dependencies to make sure you have as a prerequisite  such as node.js, install react developer tools extension for chrome. 

Also heres a link to github's create-react-app in how to install it. 
```
npx create-react-app . 
cd NameOfApp
npm start
```
the . allows us to create the react app in the folder, if not you can also put the name of the app and will create the react app in the new named folder. 
(ensure no capitals due to react naming restrictions)

```
rce 'tab'
```
is a shortcut in creating the name of the files item
